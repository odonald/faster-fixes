/**
 * Jira expires dynamic webhook registrations 30 days after they are created, and
 * an expired registration fails silently: outbound mirroring keeps working while
 * inbound status sync simply goes quiet.
 *
 * Weekly rather than monthly so the schedule has headroom — two consecutive failed
 * runs still leave more than a fortnight before the cliff.
 *
 * This run only fans out. Doing the Jira calls inline would put every organization
 * in one execution, where a single slow site eats the 50s checkpoint budget and one
 * dead grant fails the batch for everyone.
